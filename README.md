# NL4Cell: Integrating NLP with single cell data analysis

## Background

### Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) has taken the world by storm. In NLP, the objective is to create artificial intelligence (AI) that is able to read and determine meaning behind language just as a human would. While this has led to some interesting linguistic applications, the technology behind language comprehension can be adapted to various domains including biological data.

Recently there has been a paradigm shift in how people train and use language models. Rather than creating and fully training a model for a singular task, large pretrained models have been created (e.g. BERT, GPT-3, etc.) that have a generalized fluency over language. Then individuals with specific aims can copy these pretrained models and "fine tune" them in order to make it more applicable to their specific tasks. For example, a team interested in medical record analysis can download a pretrained model which learned English from mining Wikipedia, and then they can fine tune the model on their smaller electronic health record database. The model's generalized knowledge of English gained from Wikipedia transfers over to a more specific task which helps combat overfitting and saves time on training. 

### Single Cell Sequencing
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to view the gene expression profiles on an individual cellular basis. In short: we can look at *exactly* what genes a cell is using an how much it is using them. This has revolutionized the way we can study biology by being able to describe the activities and inner-workings of cells in an extremely high-resolution.

There are too many applications of scRNA-seq to enumerate here (futher complicated by how rapidly the field is developing), but there numerous tasks and applications which allow us to gain valueable insight into how both healthy and diseased cells operate spanning domains from embrology to cancer to diabetes.
